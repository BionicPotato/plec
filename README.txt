Compiler for my own invented programming language, PLE. PLE is a temporary name and stands for Programming Language Experiment.
I don't have a precise specification for this language yet but I have an idea of what it will look like. For now I'm just experimenting around.
As of today, it's not a fully functional compiler yet.
