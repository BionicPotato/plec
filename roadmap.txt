Make statements get added to Target
Make compile script work for a fresh repo
Better error system
Move headers to an include directory
Add a few statements/expressions to make the next things possible/relevant
Distinguish between Variable (the variable) and VariableExpr (expression that refers to a variable)
 - more generally, distinguish between "something" and "expression that refers to something"
Add a way to get the type of an expression (error if types don't match)
Conflate statements and expressions: statements are just expressions that evaluate to void
Distinguish between runtime statements/expressions and compile-time statements/expressions (the latter don't have virtual function codegen())
When getNextStatement encounters a {, it creates a StatementList and passes its lexer to it so it can get its tokens; when the sub-StatementList's getNextStatement encounters }, it returns false
Add flow control

Generalize run and codegen like this:
    void XyzStmt::run(Runner& r) {
        r.push(xyz);
        r.pop(abc);
        r.mem.at(123).set(456);
    }
which can then be called either with a CodeGenerator for compiling or an Interpreter for interpreting
Do not put CodeGenerator and Interpreter in the core library; another library
